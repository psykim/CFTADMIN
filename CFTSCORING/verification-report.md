# CFTSCORING Website Verification Report

## Summary
The website at https://psykim.github.io/CFTSCORING/ has been **completely replaced** with a different application. Instead of the Rey Complex Figure Test (CFT) scoring tool, it now hosts an "Animal Category Fluency Test Scorer" (동물범주형유창성검사 채점기).

## Key Findings

### 1. Application Change
- **Expected**: Rey CFT scoring tool with percentile displays and "분석 과정 보기" button
- **Found**: Animal Category Fluency Test application
- The original CFT scoring functionality is no longer available at this URL

### 2. Current Application Features
- Animal naming test with time intervals (0-15s, 15-30s, 30-45s, 45-60s)
- Database management for animal names
- CSV batch processing functionality
- Completely different from the CFT scoring tool

### 3. Repository Status
- GitHub repository exists at https://github.com/psykim/CFTSCORING
- All files in the repository are now related to the animal fluency test
- No CFT-related files are visible in the repository
- Repository has 58 JavaScript files, mostly related to animal database and scoring

### 4. URLs Checked
- https://psykim.github.io/CFTSCORING/CFTSCORING.html ✗ (Animal test)
- https://psykim.github.io/CFTSCORING/ ✗ (Animal test)
- https://psykim.github.io/CFTSCORING/index.html ✗ (Animal test)
- https://psykim.github.io/CFT/ ✗ (404 Not Found)
- https://psykim.github.io/cft-scoring/ ✗ (404 Not Found)

## Conclusion
The CFT scoring tool that was expected to show:
- Percentile displays in "<5" or "≥5" format
- "분석 과정 보기" (View Analysis Process) button
- CFT test components (복사/Copy, 즉시회상/Immediate Recall, 지연회상/Delayed Recall, 재인/Recognition)

**Is no longer available** at the expected URL. The entire application has been replaced with a different neuropsychological assessment tool.

## Recommendations
1. Check if the CFT scoring tool has been moved to a different repository or URL
2. Contact the repository owner to inquire about the CFT scoring tool's new location
3. Check if there's a backup or archive of the original CFT scoring tool
